Physical Design Workshop repo

## Description
This repository is a summary of the 5-day workshop of VLSI/SoC Physical Design using opensouce EDA tools provided by VSD. It is organized day-by-day as follows:

## Day 1

First day is used to introduce the cloud based structure of the workshop. The learning platform is divided in assessments (MCQs) and learning skills (DXSKXs). Also, a web based linux virtual machine is provided to labs hands-on execution.

Cloud based learning is guided through learning skils as follows:

### Fundamentals
- Board design x chip design
- packages x chip/die (composed by PADs + core) x IC
- Foundry IP's x IP's x Macros

### RISC-V ISA
-
-

### Design tools
-
-

### Hands-on Labs
-
-

## Day 2
Second workshop day begins with Chip Floorplanning concept. Some steps are introduced as part of Chip Floorplanning phase:
    1) Define width and height of core and die based on standard cell dimensions
    - Place all standard cells inside the core
    - notions of utilization factor and aspect ratio.
    2) Define location of pre-placed cells
    - separate circuits in to blocks or modules
    - select available IP's
    * The arrangement of the cells (IP's, blocks, modules) is referred as floorplanning.
    * pre-placed cells are placed in user-defined locations before automated place and route.
    3)
    

## Day 3

Third day is focused on the design and characterization of one library cell using MAGIC layout tool and ngspice.

### SPICE Simulations (pre-layout)
- SPICE deck / netlisting
- ngspice intro with simulation commands (source, run, setplot, display, plot...)
- 

### Art of Layout - EulerÂ´s path and stick diagram

### Hands-on Labs

For the third day labs, the MCQs guide to use ngspice_labs repo @ github.

**First step is to clone ngspice_labs repo**

    git clone https://github.com/kunalg123/ngspice_labs.git
