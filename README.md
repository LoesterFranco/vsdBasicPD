Physical Design Workshop repo

## Description
This repository is a summary of the 5-day workshop of VLSI/SoC Physical Design using opensouce EDA tools provided by VSD. It is organized day-by-day as follows:

## Day 1

First day is used to introduce the cloud based structure of the workshop. The learning platform is divided in assessments (MCQs) and learning skills (DXSKXs). Also, a web based linux virtual machine is provided to labs hands-on execution.

Cloud based learning is guided through learning skils as follows:

### Fundamentals
- Board design x chip design
- packages x chip/die (composed by PADs + core) x IC
- Foundry IP´s x IP´s x Macros

### RISC-V ISA
-
-

### Design tools

-

### Hands-on Labs
-

## Day 3

Third day is focused on the design and characterization of one library cell using MAGIC layout tool and ngspice.

### SPICE Simulations (pre-layout)

### Hands-on Labs

For the third day labs, the MCQs guide to use ngspice_labs repo @ github.

** First step is to clone ngspice_labs repo **
  git clone https://github.com/kunalg123/ngspice_labs.git
 




## Day 4
